Basically, this is a very quick and simple HTML5 canvas experiment about a few things:

- Loading images using the files API
- Display using canvas element
- Simple manipulation using canvas element
- Interaction with canvas element
- Exporting images from canvas element

(Also entirely by chance and using Bootstrap, it happens to be responsive for free! Yay for web tech)
